## Notes: Above install2.r uses --deps TRUE to get Suggests dependencies as well,
## dplyr and ggplot are already part of tidyverse, but listed explicitly to get their (many) suggested dependencies.
## In addition to the the title 'tidyverse' packages, devtools is included for package development.
## RStudio wants formatR for rmarkdown, even though it's not suggested.
## remotes included for installation from heterogenous sources including git/svn, local, url, and specific cran versions
